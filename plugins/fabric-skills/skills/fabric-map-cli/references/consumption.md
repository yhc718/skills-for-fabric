# fabric-map-cli consumption mode

## Capability questions

General questions about supported sources or connections need no workspace,
Map lookup, or authentication. Read the relevant source adapter's capability
summary: [Lakehouse](authoring/lakehouse.md),
[Eventhouse](authoring/eventhouse.md),
[connections](authoring/connections.md), [Ontology](authoring/ontology.md), or
[variable references](authoring/variables.md). These documentation reads remain in
consumption mode; do not run the adapters' authoring or source-validation steps.
Distinguish documented Map adapters from the broader Fabric connector catalog.

## Resolve the workspace

For artifact inspection, ask for missing workspace and Map identity rather
than guessing. Listing requires only the workspace.

Use the Fabric API audience and attribution header on every request:

```powershell
$base = "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1"
$skill = "fabric-map-cli"

az rest --method get `
  --resource "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com" `
  --url "$base/workspaces" `
  --headers "x-ms-fabric-skill=$skill"
```

Follow all pages, exact-match `displayName`, and stop for user disambiguation if
more than one workspace matches. If a workspace ID is supplied, verify it with
`GET /v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}` rather than trusting a guessed name.

## List and resolve Maps

```powershell
az rest --method get `
  --resource "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com" `
  --url "$base/workspaces/$workspaceId/maps" `
  --headers "x-ms-fabric-skill=$skill"
```

Prefer `continuationToken` on the original list endpoint until exhausted;
otherwise resolve a relative `continuationUri` against the request URL. Keep
service-provided regional `/v1/` continuation paths on the public Fabric
origin rather than forwarding credentials to an unvalidated host. Optional
`rootFolderId` and `recursive` parameters can narrow folder scope. Resolve a Map
by exact display name; zero matches means not found, and multiple matches
require user selection.
Absent or null continuation fields end pagination; guard absent properties
under PowerShell strict mode.

For metadata:

```http
GET /v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/maps/{mapId}
```

Metadata inspection requires read permission and `Item.Read.All` or
`Item.ReadWrite.All`.

## Read and decode a definition

```http
POST /v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/maps/{mapId}/getDefinition
```

This is a read-only action even though it uses POST. It can return `202
Accepted`; poll `Location` using `Retry-After`, then obtain the operation result.
Capture HTTP status and headers (for example with `Invoke-WebRequest` and an
in-memory Azure CLI Fabric token), not just `az rest` body output. Preserve the
skill header on every poll and result GET. Handle synchronous `200` too; stop
on failed/cancelled operations or a bounded timeout. Only forward authentication
to the trusted Fabric API host.
Normalize PowerShell header arrays to their first string value. For a regional
LRO Location, use the validated operation UUID with public
`/v1/operations/{operationId}` and `/result` endpoints.
The public API currently requires read/write permission and
`Item.ReadWrite.All` for this operation. If the caller has only read permission,
report that metadata can be inspected but the public definition cannot be
retrieved with the current identity.

Decode every `InlineBase64` part as UTF-8. `map.json` is required; `.platform`
and source-specific parts are optional. For source-specific integrity checks,
consult the relevant adapter without entering its authoring workflow.

Never execute embedded queries merely to inspect a definition. Treat them as
configuration unless the user separately asks to validate results through the
source's read-only workflow.

## Summary shape

Use real metadata and decoded definition, never a sample or inferred default.
If retrieval fails, report the limitation and summarize only what was obtained.

Present the Map in this order:

1. Item metadata: name, description, workspace, Map ID.
2. Basemap: style, theme, center/zoom/pitch/bearing, language, geopolitical view,
   and enabled controls; distinguish omitted settings from explicit values.
3. Data sources: item type and resolved display name when available.
4. Layer sources: name, type, refresh interval, source item/connection.
5. Layers: visibility, geometry/point rendering, spatial columns, filters,
   labels, and tooltips.
6. Definition integrity findings.

For file-backed Maps, also report the exact `Files/...` paths, format, selected
PMTiles internal layers, geometry family, data-driven color/size fields, labels,
tooltips, saved filters (including locked state), opacity, and top-to-bottom
layer order. Report explicit hidden layers; do not confuse them with deleted
sources. Omitted values are not saved defaults.

Distinguish three extents: the **full source extent**, the **filtered feature
extent**, and the **saved initial camera** (`center`/`zoom`). A source can cover
more than the selected region or imagery footprint. Neither the filename nor
a source's header bounds
proves the currently displayed area. Current browser pan/zoom and temporary
viewer filters may differ from saved values. Report them only when observed,
and never save them during an explanation. PMTiles zoom availability and tile
fragments are not the logical feature count; attribute counts to their evidence
(complete source scan, archive metadata, or verified distinct source IDs).

Definition readback proves saved configuration; source inspection supplies
compatibility evidence, not a guarantee of service acceptance; opening the Map
proves rendering only for the observed view. Report source-load errors as
returned and distinguish them from successful definition persistence.
Do not silently "repair" any of these during consumption.

For Ontology layers, include the referenced entity and spatial properties,
and the source generation when verified. Use the adapter's format checks and
distinguish unsupported formats from invalid definitions.
For variable-backed sources, retain the expression and distinguish the declared
reference from its resolved target. Inspect the library's active value set and
definition only when needed to answer the request; do not change either or
execute source queries. If resolution is unavailable, report it as unverified,
not as a missing source or permission to replace the expression with an ID.

Redact credentials and sensitive connection details. IDs may be shown when
useful for administration, but do not mistake an ID for a display name.

## Read-only integrity checks

- `map.json` exists, decodes as UTF-8 JSON, and references a known schema.
- Each UUID-formatted field is valid.
- Every `layerSettings[].sourceId` resolves to exactly one layer source.
- When present, each layer source's `datasourceId` resolves to exactly one
  `dataSources` entry. Validate identifier formats against the Map's declared
  schema; do not impose UUID requirements on fields it defines as strings.
- Variable expressions are checked against the declared schema and expected
  reference type; JSON Schema alone does not prove variable resolution.
- Adapter-owned parts and spatial mappings agree with their source types.
- Distinguish definition references from independently verified source access;
  inspect source metadata only when needed, not credentials or underlying data.
- Refresh intervals are nonnegative.
- Opacity and numeric style ranges satisfy the published schema.
- Unknown fields are reported, not removed.

Schema validation is read-only. A valid definition does not guarantee that data
currently exists or that the UI can render every feature.

## Rules

### MUST

- Perform only GETs and the read-only `POST .../getDefinition`.
- Handle pagination and LROs.
- Preserve and inspect all definition parts.
- Say explicitly when permissions prevent definition retrieval.
- Switch to authoring mode before any proposed fix is applied.

### AVOID

- Updating a definition as a way to test whether it is valid.
- Executing source queries without the user's request.
- Fetching connection credentials.
- Treating Azure Maps resources or Power BI map visuals as Fabric Map items.
